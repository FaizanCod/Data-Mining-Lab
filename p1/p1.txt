Text mining helps companies automate the process of classifying text. The classification could be based on several attributes, including topic, intent, sentiment, and language. Many manual and tedious tasks can be eliminated with the help of text mining. Suppose you need to understand how the customers feel about a software application you offer. Of course, you can manually go through user reviews, but if there are thousands of reviews, the process becomes tedious and time-consuming. Text mining makes it quick and easy to analyze large and complex data sets and derive relevant information from them. In this case, text mining enables you to identify the general sentiment of a product. This process of determining whether the reviews are positive, negative, or neutral is called sentiment analysis or opinion mining. Further, text mining can be used to determine what users like or dislike or what they want to be included in the next update. You can also use it to identify the keywords customers use in association with certain products or topics. Organizations can use text mining tools to dig deeper into text data to identify relevant business insights or discover interrelationships within texts that would otherwise go undetected with search engines or traditional applications.
